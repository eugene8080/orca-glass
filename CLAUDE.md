# Orca Glass fork
Updated: 2026-11-01

Read the machine-level instructions first. This fork targets Windows desktop
Orca, the Even Realities Android app, and G2 glasses.

## Explicit user constraint

Codex only. Do not launch, test, or interact with Claude until Eugene explicitly
authorizes it. Keep server-side provider restrictions in place. Historical
upstream Claude code is not evidence of authorization to test it.

## Current work

Read TODOS.md and docs/native-terminal.md before continuing setup. The active
route is official Even Terminal over Tailscale, with Codex as default. Its
provider default does not prohibit a client from selecting another provider.
The user chose to develop the custom Orca bridge on 2026-10-31, with sentences as
primary input and exact choices only for explicit menus. Reuse upstream code.
Public Even Hub SDK exposes PCM, not native transcription; reuse the upstream
Whisper flow with Windows support. See docs/voice-input.md for verified scope.
The experimental fork uses a local Node bridge and an HTTPS Cloudflare Quick Tunnel;
that runtime is stopped, with local tests passed but hardware unverified.
Direct Even WebView-to-Orca mobile protocol transport is not implemented.
Do not claim phone or glasses verification from desktop tests or mock menus.

Use `npm test`, `npm --prefix app run build`, and `npm run doctor` for local checks.
Pairing tokens, local runtime state, and QR files stay untracked. Stage explicit
paths only. No public marketplace publication without a user request.
